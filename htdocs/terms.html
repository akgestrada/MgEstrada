                    <h3>SoC</h3>
                    <p>A "System on Chip" (SoC) is a compact Integrated Circuit (IC) that accommodates all computing elements. It's the core of your device and determines its performance. Nevertheless, hardware is just a mere object without optimized software. The finest gadgets have a harmonized blend of hardware and software.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step-box">
                    <h3>RAM and ROM</h3>
                    <p>RAM is Random Access Memory and ROM is Read-Only Memory. RAM is responsible for holding frequently used applications in order to enhance their performance. ROM, on the other hand, is responsible for storing the operating system of the smartphone. While a section of ROM is reserved for the system, the remaining space can be utilized by users to store data and download applications.</p>

                <div class="step-box">
                    <h3>CPU and GPU</h3>
                    <p>The main computing brain of your device is the Central Processing Unit (CPU) which manages all complicated calculations including app functionality and multitasking. On the other hand, the Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) deals with graphics-intensive tasks like video playback, animations, and mobile gaming. A powerful processor can significantly improve the overall performance of your smartphone.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step-box">
                    <h3>Network</h3>
                    <p>The character G in 2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G refers to the generation of the network. Every generation is a development that includes extra features, wider coverage, and superior data speeds. LTE, which means Long Term Evolution, is specifically designed to function on 4G networks and beyond. It provides faster data speeds compared to the previous standard known as GSM, which stands for Global System for Mobiles. Both of these norms originated in Europe and are acknowledged globally.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step-box">
                    <h3>VoLTE</h3>
                    <p>VoLTE stands for Voice over Long Term Evolution. Apart from increased data speeds, LTE is also used to make and receive calls using the internet.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step-box">
                    <h3>NFC</h3>
                    <p>NFC, which is an acronym for Near Field Communication, permits communication between gadgets and NFC tags. It's a method of transferring data wirelessly between two nearby devices. The technology has evolved from Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and functions as a component of a wireless connection.</p>

                <div class="step-box">
                    <h3>Megapixels and UltraPixels</h3>
                    <p>A megapixel is a metric for graphic resolution that quantifies one million pixels, commonly used in camera lenses. Greater megapixels usually correspond with a higher image resolution. On the other hand, UltraPixels is a marketing jargon coined by HTC to indicate that bigger pixels on a smaller surface area lead to a more refined image. Images captured with UltraPixels are usually lower in resolution.</p>

                    <h3>AMOLED, OLED and IPS</h3>
                    <p>AMOLED, OLED, and IPS are display technologies used in smartphones. AMOLED is active-matrix organic light-emitting diode and OLED is organic light-emitting diodes, while IPS is In-plane switching. AMOLED and OLED are LED display technologies, while IPS is a screen technology used in LCDs. AMOLED and OLED are known for their deep blacks, high contrast, and vibrant colors due to their ability to control light from each diode. IPS technology, on the other hand, focuses on providing vibrant colors and high contrast.</p>

                <div class="step-box">
                    <h3>Battery</h3>
                    <p>Li-ion or lithium-ion batteries are commonly used in electronic devices due to their rechargeable nature and high energy density. They offer benefits such as minimal memory effect and low self-discharge. On the other hand, mAh, which stands for milliampere-hour, refers to the amount of power a battery can deliver over the course of one hour. It is an important metric for determining the battery life of a device.</p>

                <div class="step-box">
                    <h3>Ports</h3>
                    <p>The Micro-USB is a widely-used standard port found in most gadgets and smartphones, which is based on either USB 2.0 or, rarely, USB 3.0. Its data transfer speeds range from 480 Mbps to 5 Gbps. On the other hand, the USB Type-C port is an advanced version of all USB ports, featuring reversible use and faster data transfer speeds up to 10 Gbps and quicker charging capabilities. Meanwhile, the Lighting Port is an exclusive Apple patent utilized by their products, although the company appears to be adopting the USB Type-C port for its future devices due to its universal acceptance. Lastly, the 3.5mm Headphone jack, an age-old analogue port, is commonly used in today's phones for audio output and input, despite not being confined to such functions.</p>
