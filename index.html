                            <p>The best iPhone ever comes with a wide range of advancements, and even if you don't consider any of them groundbreaking or relevant to your usage, they're there and add up. The brightest screen by a country mile, now with AoD, a pill for the notch-ache, a camera system with all-around improvements and great full-res images, and emergency hardware/software features - that's the new stuff. These come on top of Pro Max staples like great battery life, superb speakers, and premium and durable build quality. The most potent chipset in the business and at least 5 years of support for the software you've known for ages (and likely love and hate at the same time) are other classic arguments for the iPhone, Pro Max included.</p>

                            <h3>Samsung S22 Ultra</h3>
                            <p>An upmarket phone with a stylus is essentially a Samsung-exclusive offering. This is the latest and most powerful one and it can carry that S Pen inside it unlike the Fold or last year's Ultra. It's not as clear cut when it comes to the camera, where we could come up with potential alternatives - as good, or maybe a touch superior in this or that. But there's no denying that the S22 Ultra is a superbly capable all-rounded cameraphone, easily Samsung's best yet. It's properly good when it comes to the fundamentals too, unsurprisingly. Battery life is about as solid as you can expect from a modern-day flagship, the software is refined and feature-rich, the design is understated, yet recognizable and stylish. The Galaxy S22 Ultra may not have 'Note' in its name, but deep inside we know it is one, probably the last of its kind.</p>

                            <p>The X80 Pro is the newest in a lineup of vivos with awesome camera hardware that takes wonderful pictures and captures nice videos. It has an excellent display, charges quickly to make up for what is mostly average battery life, its stereo speakers are among the better ones, while the large ultrasonic fingerprint reader is pure joy to use. A design that turns heads is also a plus in our book, even if that fancy back may be lacking in grip. The missteps we can point out in the X80 Pro's performance are in the... performance department, where we observed significant heat buildup and thermal throttling. Then again, the limited display refresh rate in gaming should help ensure that doesn't happen too often. In any case, it's the quad camera on the vivo X80 Pro's back that is the star of the show.</p>

                            <p>The Poco X4 Pro 5G is a good smartphone - it has adequate specs sheet and attractive pricing for 2022, all things considered. But the 2021 mid-range models are widely available and more affordable, and it just doesn't make sense buying it right now, not until a price cut is introduced or its competitors - retired. But what we know is that this Poco X4 Pro makes more sense than many of the recently launched Redmi Note 11 phones models.</p>

                            <h3>Google Pixel 7</h3>
                            <p>The camera system is the single biggest Pixel 7 Pro selling point that comes to mind, and it brings some welcome improvements, even if a bit modest. Similarly challenging to put a number on is the software experience - benchmarks certainly don't do the 7 Pro any justice. But it's when getting to the numbers that the Pixel 7 Pro struggles to compete on quite the same level as a lot of the other big-name rivals. Battery life is markedly worse than on a current iPhone, and a Galaxy will likely get you better longevity too. Neither Apple nor Samsung are industry leaders in charging speed, but Google has become an industry... trailer? Two hours for a full charge can turn into an actual issue in day-to-day use, we reckon. And then, despite all the gushing over Pixel cameras, there's potential for improvement here or there as well.</p>

            <p>We like tech! There is so much to consider when you want to buy a phone smartly, its enough to leave everyone confused. To put our hobby and knowledge to use, we compiled our a list of recommendations and everything you need to consider when buying a phone.</p>

        <div class="more-reason">
            <p>Companies do their best to get as much sales as they can. From making misleading claims to stopping a reviewer from releasing a full review that will show its flaws, companies will do everything. This is not something only a few companies do. Even large ones like Samsung have been caught doing it. But with this guide, we aim to help people buy their phone smartly. At the end of the day, you should pick what you like, because you are going to be the one using it. Even if something is popular, if you don't like it, you can't just force yourself to like it, specially because it came from your hard earned money.</p>
